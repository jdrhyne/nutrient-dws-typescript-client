# Implementation Considerations

## Key Considerations

### 1. Security First
Ensure API key handling follows best practices for both environments:
- Never log or expose API keys
- Support both static API keys and dynamic token providers
- Implement secure storage recommendations
- Validate authentication before making requests

### 2. Type Safety
Maintain strong typing throughout, leveraging TypeScript's full capabilities:
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Implement comprehensive type guards
- Leverage discriminated unions for API responses
- Ensure full type inference in fluent APIs

### 3. Developer Experience
Focus on intuitive APIs and clear error messages:
- Provide meaningful error messages with context
- Implement fluent, chainable APIs
- Include comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Support IDE autocompletion and IntelliSense

### 4. Performance
Optimize for both bundle size and runtime performance:
- Implement tree-shaking support
- Use lazy loading where appropriate
- Minimize dependencies
- Optimize HTTP request patterns

### 5. Compatibility
Test across Node.js versions and modern browsers:
- Support Node.js 14+
- Test in major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Handle environment-specific APIs gracefully
- Provide clear compatibility documentation

## Technical Decisions

### Environment Detection
- Automatic detection of Node.js vs browser environment
- Graceful fallbacks for missing APIs
- Clear error messages for unsupported environments

### Error Handling
- Structured error hierarchy
- Consistent error response format
- Actionable error messages
- Proper error code mapping

### API Design
- Consistent naming conventions
- Predictable method signatures
- Fluent builder patterns where appropriate
- Clear separation of concerns
